## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries 

### What I learned

- Using "flex-direction: column-reverse" to reverse the direction of flex items when the flexbox changed from horizontal to verticle. 

```css 
.card-component {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column-reverse;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
        max-width: 375px;
    }
```

### Continued development

Learning about responsive design and elements placement within the html code.
